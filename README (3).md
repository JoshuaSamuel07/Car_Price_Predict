# Car Price Prediction By Using Machine Learning


This project was aimed at using features such as car name, year, kms_driven, fule_type and Transmission and how many Owners have used it to figure out what the potential price of a car can be valued at. 

I have done steps from data cleaning to exploratory data analysis to splitting into train and test and developing a Random Forest Regressor model and turning that into a pickle file that can be used in a cloud platform or transfered.
